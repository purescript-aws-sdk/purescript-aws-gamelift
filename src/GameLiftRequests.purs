-- | <p>Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. </p> <p>When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.</p> <p>To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. </p> <p>If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to <code>FAILED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. </p> <p>Matchmaking-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>

-- | <p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>.</p> <p>Alias-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListAliases</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteAlias</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ResolveAlias</a> </p> </li> </ul>

-- | <p>Creates a new Amazon GameLift build record for your game server binary files and points to the location of your game server build files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location. </p> <p>Game server binaries must be combined into a <code>.zip</code> file for use with Amazon GameLift. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-intro.html">Uploading Your Game</a> for more information. </p> <important> <p>To create new builds quickly and easily, use the AWS CLI command <b> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html">upload-build</a> </b>. This helper command uploads your build and creates a new build record in one step, and automatically handles the necessary permissions. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-cli-uploading.html"> Upload Build Files to Amazon GameLift</a> for more help.</p> </important> <p>The <code>CreateBuild</code> operation should be used only when you need to manually upload your build files, as in the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Store a build file in an Amazon S3 bucket under your own AWS account. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to that Amazon S3 bucket. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-build-cli-uploading.html#gamelift-build-cli-uploading-create-build"> Create a Build with Files in Amazon S3</a> for detailed help. To create a new build record using files in your Amazon S3 bucket, call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the storage location of your game build.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload a build file directly to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3 account. To use this option, you first call <code>CreateBuild</code> with a build name and operating system. This action creates a new build record and returns an Amazon S3 storage location (bucket and key only) and temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build file to the storage location (see the Amazon S3 topic <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html">Uploading Objects</a>). You can upload files to a location only once. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, this operation creates a new build record with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status. You can use <a>DescribeBuild</a> to check the status of your build.

-- | <p>Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You set up a fleet to use instances with certain hardware specifications (see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a> for more information), and deploy your game build to run on each instance. </p> <p>To create a new fleet, you must specify the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) the build ID of a successfully uploaded game build, (3) an EC2 instance type, and (4) a run-time configuration, which describes the server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. If you don't specify a fleet type (on-demand or spot), the new fleet uses on-demand instances by default.</p> <p>You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fleet description</p> </li> <li> <p>Access permissions for inbound traffic</p> </li> <li> <p>Fleet-wide game session protection</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource usage limits</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>VPC peering connection (see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html">VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group. By adding multiple fleets to a metric group, you can view aggregated metrics for all the fleets in the group. </p> <p>If the <code>CreateFleet</code> call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a fleet record. Status: <code>NEW</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.</p> <p>Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Downloads the game build to the new instance and installs it. Statuses: <code>DOWNLOADING</code>, <code>VALIDATING</code>, <code>BUILDING</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds. Status: <code>ACTIVATING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sets the fleet's status to <code>ACTIVE</code> as soon as one server process is ready to host a game session.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Fleet-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateFleet</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListFleets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p>Describe fleets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetPortSettings</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetUtilization</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeRuntimeConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Update fleets:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetAttributes</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetPortSettings</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateRuntimeConfiguration</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Manage fleet capacity:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> (automatic scaling)</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteFleet</a> </p> </li> </ul>

-- | <p>Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This action creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it.</p> <p>To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a <a>GameSession</a> object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.</p> <p> <b>Idempotency tokens.</b> You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.</p> <p> <b>Resource creation limits.</b> If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.</p> <p> <b>Player acceptance policy.</b> By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using <a>UpdateGameSession</a> to change the game session's player session creation policy.</p> <p> <b>Game session logs.</b> Logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days.

-- | <p>Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> and reference the queue name.</p> <p> <b>Destination order.</b> When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.</p> <p> <b>Player latency policies.</b> For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc. </p> <p>To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a new queue object is returned.</p> <p>Queue-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeGameSessionQueues</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateGameSessionQueue</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteGameSessionQueue</a> </p> </li> </ul>

-- | <p>Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A matchmaking configuration sets out guidelines for matching players and getting the matches into games. You can set up multiple matchmaking configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your game. Each matchmaking ticket (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>) specifies a configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support the configuration being used. </p> <p>To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.</p> <p> <b>Player acceptance</b> -- In each configuration, you have the option to require that all players accept participation in a proposed match. To enable this feature, set <i>AcceptanceRequired</i> to true and specify a time limit for player acceptance. Players have the option to accept or reject a proposed match, and a match does not move ahead to game session placement unless all matched players accept. </p> <p> <b>Matchmaking status notification</b> -- There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket status with <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a>; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration (see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html"> Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking</a>). Since notifications promise only "best effort" delivery, we recommend calling <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> if no notifications are received within 30 seconds.</p> <p>Operations related to match configurations and rule sets include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteMatchmakingConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CreateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmakingRuleSets</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> </p> </li> </ul>

-- | <p>Creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams, and sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type. Rule sets are used in matchmaking configurations, which define how matchmaking requests are handled. Each <a>MatchmakingConfiguration</a> uses one rule set; you can set up multiple rule sets to handle the scenarios that suit your game (such as for different game modes), and create a separate matchmaking configuration for each rule set. See additional information on rule set content in the <a>MatchmakingRuleSet</a> structure. For help creating rule sets, including useful examples, see the topic <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>Once created, matchmaking rule sets cannot be changed or deleted, so we recommend checking the rule set syntax using <a>ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet</a> before creating the rule set.</p> <p>To create a matchmaking rule set, provide the set of rules and a unique name.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.</p> <p>A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.</p> <p>When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration.

Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. </p> <p>To place a new game session request, specify the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings</p> </li> <li> <p>A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement.

-- | <p>Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created. </p> <p>To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. For more detail how to set up backfilling, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-backfill.html"> Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch</a>. </p> <p>The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the <a>GameSession</a> object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players.

-- | <p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a <code>MatchmakingConfiguration</code>. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-intro.html"> Adding FlexMatch to Your Game</a>.</p> <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.</p> <p> <b>Tracking ticket status</b> -- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Polling -- Call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code>. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see <a>CreateMatchmakingConfiguration</a>) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call <code>DescribeMatchmaking</code> only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Processing a matchmaking request</b> -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Your client code submits a <code>StartMatchmaking</code> request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket. </p> </li> <li> <p>FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status. </p> </li> <li> <p>If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call <a>AcceptMatch</a> for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see <code>AcceptMatch</code> for more details).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status <code>PLACING</code>. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data. </p> </li> <li> <p>When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into <code>COMPLETED</code> status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Matchmaking-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopMatchmaking</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AcceptMatch</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartMatchBackfill</a> </p> </li> </ul>
